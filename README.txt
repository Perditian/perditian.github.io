User page- The index page: links to both my biography and my resume. Included is       
    also a picture of myself.

Resume- The resume page: information about my education, coursework, skills, and
        activities.

Biography- The biography page: short description of myself and an image of my baking.


Each page is implemented as a single html file and there is 1 overarching css file
which allows for more consistent styling. 


As far as I am aware the assignment has been completly implemented.

I did not work with or collaborate with anyone on this assignment. I did however 
   recieve a few guiding tips from Jay Destories.


I worked for approximately 5 hours on this assignment.
